## NIKHEF-2024-GWDA
#### Repository hosting lecture material used during the Nikhef GW workshop 2024.
#### Uses open-source GW data analysis software like : 
-  [PyCBC](https://pycbc.org/)
-  [bilby](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby/)
-  [peregrine](https://github.com/PEREGRINE-GW/peregrine)
-  [gwpy](https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/)

### Tutorial 1
This notebook goes through the basics of data acquisition, pre-processing, matched filtering and signal consistency tests using `PyCBC`.

### Tutorial 2
This notebook uses `bilby`/`PyCBC` to demonstrate GW parameter inference for real observed data as well as simulated GW data from compact binary mergers.

### Tutorial 3 
This notebook demonstrate the use of machine learning for robust simulation-based inference of gravitational wave data detailing simulation, training and inference using `peregrine`.
